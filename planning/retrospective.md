# Retrospective

## Stop Doing

- pushing changes directly to master/main branch
- adding PRs without reviewing
- working on 1 task with the whole team
- slow communication with team members

## Continue Doing

- making branches for every part of the work and for each teem member
- making issues for all tasks
- using suitable labels for issues

## Start Doing

- everyday communication (small meetings for 15 minutes)
- assign tasks to a person
- early planning
- making small, well-named commits

## Lessons Learned

- Git commands
- collaboration Github + VSCode
- Agile method
- working with branches
- working all together in 1 document and 1 Repo
- we have to plan more time for collaboration with team
