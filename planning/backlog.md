# Backlog

A collection of user stories you can choose from. Stories inside of each priority level are not necessarily in order. You and your team will decide when to develop each story by drawing out your [Story Sequencing](#story-sequencing).

## Must-Haves

are necessary for basic usability:

- **user story name**: As a [type of user] I want to [do something] so that [I achieve some goal]
  - Given [context] when [a specific action is performed] then [a set of consequences should occur]
  - ...
- **user story name**: As a [type of user] I want to [do something] so that [I achieve some goal]
  - Given [context] when [a specific action is performed] then [a set of consequences should occur]
  - ...
- ...

## Should-Haves

will complete the user experience, but are not necessary:

- **user story name**: As a [type of user] I want to [do something] so that [I achieve some goal]
  - Given [context] when [a specific action is performed] then [a set of consequences should occur]
  - ...
- **user story name**: As a [type of user] I want to [do something] so that [I achieve some goal]
  - Given [context] when [a specific action is performed] then [a set of consequences should occur]
  - ...
- ...

## Could-Haves

would be really cool ... if there's time:

- **user story name**: As a [type of user] I want to [do something] so that [I achieve some goal]
  - Given [context] when [a specific action is performed] then [a set of consequences should occur]
  - ...
- **user story name**: As a [type of user] I want to [do something] so that [I achieve some goal]
  - Given [context] when [a specific action is performed] then [a set of consequences should occur]
  - ...
- ...
