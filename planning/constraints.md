## Internal: Voluntary

- **Copying code** from original repo is acceptable, as far as there is not much time for the project.
- **Skipping** some sections of the website that are unnecessary is ok. No or minimum Java-script due to lack of knowledge.
- **One approval** is enough for pull request too speed up the workflow, because there are not always people available for reviewing.
- **Availability of the team members** see the time [table](https://github.com/firity/HYF-GROUP2/tree/main/planning)

<!--
  constraints that your team decided on to help scope the project. they may include:
  - the number of hours you want to spend working
  - only using the colors black and white
  - technologies (sometimes you can choose what to use)
